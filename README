This is a "bundle" for Vim that builds off of the initial Scala plugin modules
by Stefan Matthias Aust and adds some more "stuff" that I find useful, including
all of my notes and customizations.

It's free for anyone to fork, clone, etc... no licensing or whatever... just do
whatever you want with it, but you can't take credit for my stuff :)

You really should be using Tim Pope's Pathogen module for Vim
(https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen and
http://tammersaleh.com/posts/the-modern-vim-config-with-pathogen) if you're
going to clone this repository because, well... you should.

Alternatively, you can use Vundle (https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) to
manage your plugins.

If you have Vundle installed, simply add the following to your .vimrc:
  Bundle 'derekwyatt/vim-scala'
and then run
  :BundleInstall
to install it.
