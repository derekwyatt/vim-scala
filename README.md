vim-scala [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lenniboy/vim-scala.png)](http://travis-ci.org/lenniboy/vim-scala)
==========

This is a "bundle" for Vim that builds off of the initial Scala plugin modules
by Stefan Matthias Aust and adds some more "stuff" that I find useful, including
all of my notes and customizations.

It's free for anyone to fork, clone, etc... no licensing or whatever... just do
whatever you want with it, but you can't take credit for my stuff :)

##Installation

You really should be using Tim Pope's [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) module for Vim (http://tammersaleh.com/posts/the-modern-vim-config-with-pathogen) if you're going to clone this repository because, well... you should.

###Vundle
Alternatively, you can use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) to
manage your plugins.

If you have Vundle installed, simply add the following to your .vimrc:

```vim
Bundle 'derekwyatt/vim-scala'
```

and then run

```vim
:BundleInstall
```

to install it.

##Sorting of import statements
    :SortScalaImports

There are differenct modes for import sorting available. For details, please
consult the vimdoc help with

    :help :SortScalaImports
